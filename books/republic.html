            <h1><u>Republic by Plato</u></h1>Presented in the form of a dialogue between
                   Socrates and three different interlocutors, this classic text is an 
                   enquiry into the notion of a perfect community and the ideal individual
                   within it. During the conversation, other questions are raised: what is
                   goodness?; what is reality?; and what is knowledge? The Republic also 
                   addresses the purpose of education and the role of both women and men 
                   as guardians of the people. With remarkable lucidity and deft use of 
                   allegory, Plato arrives at a depiction of a state bound by harmony and
                   ruled by philosopher kings.

   <h4><u>About the author...</u></h4> 
   <p>Plato was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, 
      the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered 
      the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition.
      Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire work is believed to 
      have survived intact for over 2,400 years.[3] Others believe that the oldest extant manuscript 
      dates to around AD 895, 1100 years after Plato's death. This makes it difficult to know exactly
      what Plato wrote..</p>

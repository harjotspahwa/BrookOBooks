            Summers span decades. Winter can last a lifetime. And the struggle for the
            Iron Throne has begun. As Warden of the north, Lord Eddard Stark counts it
            a curse when King Robert bestows on him the office of the Hand. His honour 
            weighs him down at court where a true man does what he will,not what he must
            ..and a dead enemy is a thing of beauty. The old gods have no power in the 
            south, Starkâ€™s family is split and there is treachery at court. Worse, the 
            vengeance-mad heir of the deposed Dragon King has grown to maturity in exile
            in the Free Cities. He claims the Iron Throne.

            <h1><u>The Story of my Life</u></h1>
     An American classic rediscovered by each generation, The Story of My Life is Helen Keller’s account of
     her triumph over deafness and blindness. Popularized by the stage play and movie The Miracle Worker, 
     Keller’s story has become a symbol of hope for people all over the world. This book–published when Keller
     was only twenty-two–portrays the wild child who is locked in the dark and silent prison of her own body. 
     With an extraordinary immediacy, Keller reveals her frustrations and rage, and takes the reader on the
     unforgettable journey of her education and breakthroughs into the world of communication. From the moment
     Keller recognizes the word “water” when her teacher finger-spells the letters, we share her triumph as “that
     living word awakened my soul, gave it light, hope, joy, set it free!” An unparalleled chronicle of courage, 
     The Story of My Life remains startlingly fresh and vital more than a century after its first publication, 
     a timeless testament to an indomitable will.

   <h4><u>About the author...</u></h4> 
   <p>Helen Adams Keller was an American author, political activist, and lecturer. She was the first deaf-blind 
      person to earn a bachelor of arts degree. The story of how Keller's teacher, Anne Sullivan, broke through the
      isolation imposed by a near complete lack of language, allowing the girl to blossom as she learned to 
      communicate, has become widely known through the dramatic depictions of the play and film The Miracle Worker.</p>

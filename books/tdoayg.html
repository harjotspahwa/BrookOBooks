            <h1><u>The Diary of a Young Girl</u></h1>
            Discovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life, Anne Frank's 
            remarkable diary has since become a world classic—a powerful reminder of the horrors 
            of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit. In 1942, with Nazis occupying 
            Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam
            and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed 
            to the Gestapo, they and another family lived cloistered in the "Secret Annexe" of an
            old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the 
            constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of 
            discovery and death

   <h4><u>About the author...</u></h4>
   <p>Annelies Marie "Anne" Frank was a German-born diarist. One of the most discussed Jewish victims
   of the Holocaust, she gained fame posthumously with the publication of The Diary of a Young Girl, 
   in which she documents her life in hiding from 1942 to 1944, during the German occupation of the 
   Netherlands in World War II. It is one of the world's most widely known books and has been the basis
   for several plays and films.
